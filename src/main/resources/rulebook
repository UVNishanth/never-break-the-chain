Coding Rulebook
* Never Nester
    * Max depth = 3 (includes function)
    * To avoid more, use:
        * Extraction: create a diff function to handle the depth
        * Inversion: move unhappy part in the ‘if’ and return, so that you can write happy part below without using an else, below
* Avoid comments
    * Instead, let your code speak for itself by naming things based on what they are supposed to be
